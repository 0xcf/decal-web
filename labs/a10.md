## Docker
This exercise is designed to give you some hands-on experience with Docker!
By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:
- Create and use a Docker container interactively
- Create a Dockerfile, which allows you to declaratively define your containers
- Run detached containers and understand port forwarding
- Use `docker-compose` to run a multi-container web application

Just a forewarning: this lab holds your hand until the last section. Not that the last part is super hard, but it'll
have a lot less instruction than previous portions which are designed to gently introduce you to Docker.

### Installing Docker
Unfortunately, Docker isn't in the official Debian `apt` repository. This means there are two methods we can use to
install it:

1. Add the official Docker repository to `/etc/apt/sources.list`. This allows us to update the version of Docker we
have on our machines with a simple `apt update` and `apt upgrade`
2. Download the `.deb` manually and just install it. If we want to upgrade Docker after we do this, we'll have to do it
manually as well.

You're welcome to use either method to install Docker. For the first method, refer to the [Docker website for
instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/#install-docker-ce). For the second method, here
is a link to a recent `.deb` you can use:
`https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/dists/stretch/pool/stable/amd64/docker-ce_18.03.0~ce-0~debian_amd64.deb`. At
this point in the course, I trust you can figure out how to install it just given that link 🙂 _hint: use `wget` and`dpkg`_

After installing, I recommend running the command `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER` so
you can use Docker as a non-root user. This means you won't have to type `sudo docker` all the time. This is optional
but for the rest of this exercise I'm going to assume that you did this. If you see some output like

```
sent invalidate(passwd) request, exiting
sent invalidate(group) request, exiting
```

This is normal, it's just adding a user to a group.

### Creating your first Docker container
To verify that you installed things correctly, try running

`docker run hello-world`

You should see some friendly output like so (hashes are probably different, don't worry about it):

```
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
b04784fba78d: Already exists
Digest: sha256:f3b3b28a45160805bb16542c9531888519430e9e6d6ffc09d72261b0d26ff74f
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Some [quick definitions from Docker's website:](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#a-brief-explanation-of-containers)

An **image** is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of
software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files. Images are useful primarily for their
speed, but images can also be used as a base to be built on top of in future images, as you'll see later with Dockerfiles. In the
last example hello-world was the image used to test our docker installation.

A **container** is a runtime instance of an image—what the image becomes in memory when actually executed.
It runs completely isolated from the host environment by default, only accessing host files and ports if configured to
do so. A container gets created upon executing docker run on an image.

This is similar to the distinction between objects and classes in Object Oriented Programming. Images would be classes,
and containers would be objects.

Be sure to read through the output from running the hello-world image to get an understanding of what the Docker daemon
was doing.

### Running an interactive container
We're now going to walk you through running a container interactively. This is useful if you ever need to play around
and install stuff on a bare system without messing up your current system. Try running the following command:

`docker run -it ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash`

The `-i` flag tells docker to keep `STDIN` open to your container, and the `-t` flag allocates a
[pseudo-TTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal) for you. Basically you need both for you to have a way to
enter text and have this display properly. At the end of the command, `/bin/bash` is just the command you want to run
once the container starts up. Try installing some packages from `apt` or just play around. It should look like a bare
Linux system.

You can exit the container with `CTRL+D`.

Notice how even though your VM is running Debian, you were able to run the Xenial version of Ubuntu in a container. If
you are curious about other variants of Linux, you can run a lot of them inside containers as well! This all works because
Linux distributions all share the Linux kernel. For that same reason, you won't be able to run MacOS or Windows in a container.
You can try running [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) (_\*tips hat\*_ M'Linux), another long-running Linux distribution:

`docker run -it fedora:latest /bin/bash`

#### Questions (answer on Gradescope)

1. What user are you logged in as by default?
2. If you start and then exit an interactive container, and then use the `docker run -it ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash`
command again, is it the same container? How can you tell?

### Basic Management
The Docker CLI (Command Line Interface) has some basic commands for you to monitor running and stopped containers,
downloaded images, and other information. We'll go over the basic commands you'll probably use, but be sure to check
out [the full reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/) if you're interested.

Firstly, you might want to see the running containers on a system. Use the following command:

`docker ps`

Since you (likely) have no containers running, you probably won't see anything interesting. However, if you pass in the
`-a` flag, you'll also be able to see containers that have stopped (make your terminal wider or it'll display weird):

```
baisang@rapture ~/d/labs> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                            PORTS               NAMES
35c048c03588        fedora:latest       "/bin/bash"              7 minutes ago       Exited (130) About a minute ago                       mystifying_edison
dd8f7cc2e0cd        fedora:latest       "/bin/bash"              10 minutes ago      Exited (1) 8 minutes ago                              romantic_mahavira
```

This lets you see a lot of useful information about the container. Observe that each container has a unique container
id and a unique human-readable name. To get more information about a container, you can use the `docker logs` command
to fetch the logs of a container (whether it's still running or exited):

`docker logs <container_id_or_name>`

This basically just gives you `stdout` and `stderr` for process(es) running in the container.

At some point, you may want to cleanup containers that have exited and you don't plan on using anymore:

`docker rm <container_id_or_name>`

will remove the container.

You may have noticed when you were running the Ubuntu or Fedora containers the first time that Docker downloaded a good
chunk of data before running the image. This is the image of the container. You can view all of the images you've
downloaded with the `docker images` command:

```
baisang@rapture ~/d/labs> docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
fedora              latest              9110ae7f579f        2 weeks ago         235MB
ubuntu              xenial              f975c5035748        3 weeks ago         112MB
```

Images can take up quite a bit of space on your machine, so you may want to clean up images that you don't plan on
using. This is especially relevant if you get errors about not having enough disk space on your machine:

`docker rmi <image_id>`

The image files, as well as various filesystems of containers, are stored in `/var/lib/docker`

We'll go over more commands later on in the lab.

### Dockerfiles
A more powerful way to interface with Docker is by using a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile allows you to define an image by
specifying all of the commands you would type manually to create an image. Docker can then build images from a specified
Dockerfile. These Dockerfiles can be put into version control and the images distributed as a binary to keep track of
both how the image is constructed and also to keep pre-built images around.

Dockerfiles are very powerful and have many different commands and features. We'll go over a basic example, but you
should check out the [reference page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) if you are trying to do anything more
complex.

Here is an example Dockerfile that will build an image that has `python3.6` installed.
It will also run `python3.6` directly, so you'll be at a python prompt instead of a bash prompt when you run it.

``` dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:bionic

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3.6 --no-install-recommends

CMD ["/usr/bin/python3.6", "-i"]
```

Note: there are some "best practices" for writing Dockerfiles that the above example doesn't use,
because it's a basic example. For instance, we probably would want to delete `/var/lib/apt/lists/*`, where `apt`
stores the package list information from `apt update`, after we are done installing packages. We may also choose to use
Linux variants that are smaller and lighter, e.g. Alpine Linux. The general philosophy is
containers should be kept as small and "light" as possible. If you're interested in this stuff, [check out this
article](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/).

What is this doing? We specify a base image `ubuntu:bionic` (release 18.04 of ubuntu, soon to be the latest LTS as of writing).
We then specify that we should run (`RUN`) the command `apt-get update` and then `apt-get install python3.6` so we can
install `python3.6` (note that this package probably isn't in `apt` on your own VMs, which are running an older Debian stable!)
Then we set the default command (`CMD`) of the container to run the `python3.6` interpreter in interactive mode.

Copy the contents of the Dockerfile above into a file named `Dockerfile`.
Then use Docker to build it with the following command:

`docker build -t mypython:latest .`

This tells Docker to look in the current directory for a Dockerfile to build, and build it.
The `-t` flag tells it to tag this build with the name `mypython:latest`.
Docker will look for a Dockerfile in the current directory since you specified `.`

Remember, you can see all of the images you've built on your machine with the `docker images` command.

#### Questions
1. Run the image you just built. Since we specified the default `CMD`, you can just do `docker run -it
mypython:latest`. **What do you observe?**
2. Write and build a Dockerfile that installs the packages `fortune` and `fortunes-min` and runs the `fortune`
executable (located in `/usr/games/fortune` after you install it). Note that you won't need to use the `-it` flags when you run
the container as `fortune` doesn't need `STDIN`.
**Submit your Dockerfile with this lab.** *Hint:* if you're having trouble writing your Dockerfile, try booting an
interactive container and installing both packages. How can you translate what you did interactively to a Dockerfile?
3. Paste the output of your `docker images` command after questions 1 and 2.

### Detached Containers and Ports
You might not always want containers to be running interactively. For instance, if you are running a web server, you'll
likely want the container to continue keep running until you explicitly want to end it. Docker supports this use case
with the `-d` flag, which starts containers in [detached
mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#detached--d).

We'll explore a bit about detached containers by running a standalone Apache container. The image has already been
built for you; you can find it on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd/) as `httpd`.

Docker creates a separate virtual network for containers, so you will need to do forward your host port to your
container's port (this is called [port forwarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding), or port mapping).
The container is listening on port 80, so let's try to forward our host machine's port 5050 to the container's
port 80 when we run the container:

`docker run -d -p=5050:80 httpd`

The `-p` flag takes in a colon separated pair of `HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT` (it can actually accept a ton of more
options, but don't worry about that for now). You should be able to view visit `<url_of_host_machine>:5050`, assuming
you don't have anything else running on that port (if you're not on campus, you can just `curl <url_of_host_machine>:5050`
from your VM or another machine on campus, e.g. ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu), and see the words "**It works!**". You may need to allow
the port 5050 on your firewall, simply run the command `ufw allow 5050`

You can actually "attach" to running containers and run more commands in them, similar to how `docker run` works. Use
the `docker exec` command:

`docker exec <container_id_or_name> <command>`

To stop this container, use `docker stop <container_id_or_name>`.

You can restart the container using `docker restart <container_id_or_name>`.

#### Questions
1. With `httpd` running in a detached container, run `/bin/bash` on the same container and paste the output of `ps
aux`. Observe that there's very few processes running as compared to running `ps aux` on your VM. Why is this the case?
(Think about what the `ps` command displays.)

### Dungeons and `docker-compose`
Congratulations! You've just been hired by some trash SF Bay Area tech bubble startup as their systems administrator.
Unfortunately, both the CEO and CTO are busy handling the business side, which leaves it up to you to get their web
application deployed using Docker and `docker-compose`.

Don't worry though -- while you may not have health insurance or a nice salary, you do have some of the CTO's notes and
equity to help you with your task. You get off BART at 12pm and enter your cramped SOMA coworking space, sitting down
at the desk you share with the CTO while cracking open a cold LaCroix. Checking your email, you find the following
notes from the CTO:

#### About `docker-compose`
`docker-compose` lets you define applications that require more than one container to function. For example, on a web
application you may want your actual web application running inside of a single container, and your database running in
a different container.

Typically you define applications in terms of **services**. Again, going with the web application example, there are
two distinct services: the app itself, and the database backing it. `docker-compose` lets you define different services
within a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file and run the services accordingly.

One of the nice things about `docker-compose` is that it automatically sets up a network for your containers in which:
- each container for a service is on the network and reachable from other containers on the network
- each container is discoverable on the network via its container name

This means it should be pretty simple to get our web app to connect to the database.

#### Installing
`docker-compose` is really just a python package, so ideally we should just install it with `virtualenv` and `pip` (as with most
things, the version packaged in Debian stable is too old, so we can't just `apt install` it).
Feel free to do it this way if you want, but since we're a hotshot tech startup we're gonna do this the cowboy way
(yeehaw):

```
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.20.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

#### The web application
The web application is written only the most badass rockstar tech,
[Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzkRVzciAZg). For the database, it uses the most webscale, reliable, and
persistent database available on the market today, [MongoDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs).

![everything he just said was wrong](https://i.fluffy.cc/bKHw92JKd8fKRgkK73vC881PzkXj4q9V.gif)


The web application can be found on GitHub. Note that the web app listens on port 8080, so you'll need to forward or
expose that port. Don't forget to allow it on your firewall, `ufw allow 8080`. Instructions for setting it up are located in the
`README.md` of the repository: [https://github.com/0xcf/decal-sp18-a10](https://github.com/0xcf/decal-sp18-a10)

For MongoDB, you can just use the image on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/) (a website where people can
upload built Docker images). It's just called `mongo`. For example, if you wanted to run MongoDB within a container in
detached mode:

`docker run -d mongo:latest`

#### Putting it all together
Your task is to use `docker-compose` to deploy the Node.js app with the MongoDB database. The CTO has roughly mapped
out a suggested order of tasks:

1. Write a `Dockerfile` that will allow you to run the Node.js web application
2. Write a `docker-compose.yml` file that will glue the Node.js app container with a MongoDB container

Here is a basic skeleton for `docker-compose.yml`. You will need to fill out the `web` and `database` service entries:

```
version: '3'
services:
  web:
  database:
```

By default, the Node.js web application is designed to look for a MongoDB instance at hostname `database`, so be sure
that your MongoDB service is defined under that name. `docker-compose` will make sure that the hostname `database` maps
to the container for that service.

One huge caveat: your hotshot CTO unfortunately wrote the Node.js app in a crap way where if it's not able to connect
to the MongoDB database once it starts, it'll fail and exit without retrying. Since Javascript is poison, you'll need
to find a way to make sure that the Node.js app only starts after the MongoDB container is ready to accept incoming
connections *without* modifying `server.js`. I included a wrapper script `wait-for` in the repo for the Node.js app
that will allow you to wait for the MongoDB service to be ready before launching the Node.js app. But, in order to use
the script, you will need to have `netcat` installed in your container, so be sure to include that in your Dockerfile.
See the [repo for the script](https://github.com/Eficode/wait-for) for instructions on how to use the script. Feel free
to come up with other ways to solve this issue though!

You will likely find the [Compose File Reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) useful. Additionally,
the [Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) guide will help as well, although it's a python
example instead of the superior Node.js /s I suggest poking around at other docs on that site also. I expect you to run
into errors and difficulties -- this is intended as part of the lab. Please try googling error messages and coming up
with your own fixes before asking for help, but of course feel free to ask if you get really stuck.

Hints (if you want them):
- For the Node.js Dockerfile, I recommend basing it off of `ubuntu:xenial` and installing everything you need
(`nodejs`, `npm`, etc.) via `apt`. These aren't in Debian's `apt` repository so you'd have to find another way to
install them if you use Debian.
- `npm install` needs to be run within the directory containing the repository (i.e. needs to be run within the
directory that has the `package.json` file). If you want to change the current working directory within your
Dockerfile, use the [`WORKDIR` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir)
- If you change your Dockerfile after running `docker-compose up`, you will need to run `docker-compose build` to
rebuild your services

Once you've set things up properly, just running `docker-compose up` in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml`
file will bring up your web application!

#### Questions
1. Paste your `Dockerfile` for the Node.js web application
2. Paste your `docker-compose.yml` file
