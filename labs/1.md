## Introduction
Welcome to the first lab!

All labs are graded on completeness and effort, so don't worry too much about
getting an exact right answer. (We'll release staff solutions after the lab is due!)

Labs are also usually due a week from when they are assigned. Remember to ask for help if you need it on Edstem or Discord/Slack!

It may be convenient to submit your answers to Gradescope as you go.

**Pro Tips:**
 - Here are some commands you might find helpful:
`vim, ls, cd, man, file, grep, cat, less, wget, nano, tar, ...`, (and other inferior text editors)
 - Google and `man` are your friends!

## Part 1: Shell spelunking
**Everything should be done via the shell!**

The purpose of this lab is to get you comfortable with using the shell for
things you might typically use a GUI for. While these tasks may seem simplistic
or limited, you'll quickly find that the commands have many different options
(flags) to perform tasks that are either impossible or incredibly tedious /
difficult to complete using traditional methods.

Don't worry about fully understanding how the commands work just yet- as long
as you can gain a sense of familiarity with the tools at hand, we'll be in good
shape to explore them further next week!

1. `ssh` into `tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu` using your OCF account, or login at
   [ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu](https://ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu)

2. Run the following command to download the file we have provided:
   `wget https://github.com/0xcf/decal-labs/raw/master/b1/b01.tgz`

   A `.tgz` file is actually a composition of two file formats. Sometimes
   you'll see these files as `.tar.gz` instead. A common (and old) way of
   archiving is with magnetic tapes. However, in order to archive the data, it
   needs to be a single file, and often you want to archive multiple files at
   once. This is where the `tar` command comes in (`tar` stands for tape
   archive). Tar will group (or ungroup) multiple files into a single one.

   `tar`, unless you ask it to, doesn't compress files itself though. This is
   where either `gzip` (or `bzip2`) comes in. `gzip` will compress your file,
   and so, tar + gzip is often used in conjunction. It looks something like
   this: `file --(tar)--> file.tar --(gzip)--> file.tar.gz`.

   If you read the `tar` documentation carefully enough, you'll see that you
   can give the command an option to compress your files using `gzip` as well,
   saving you a total of one line of shell command!

   To unarchive the file we provide you, run the following command:
   `tar xvzf b01.tgz`. This will provide a `b01` directory for you with some
   files for the rest of this lab.

   `tar` has a reputation for being a bit tricky with its options:
   ![XKCD 1168](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tar.png "I don't know what's worse--the fact that after 15 years of using tar I still can't keep the flags straight, or that after 15 years of technological advancement I'm still mucking with tar flags that were 15 years old when I started.")

3. Go into the `b01` directory. Make sure you're in there by running `pwd`
   (Present working directory). **What does `pwd` give you (conceptually)**?

4. There's a hidden file in the `b01` directory. **What is the secret?**

5. A malicious user made its way into my computer and created a message split
   across all the files in `nonsense/`. What does it say? **How did you find the message?** (Hint: `ls` and/or
   `xargs` will be helpful here. If you want a challenge, try to do this in a single short command- but it's ok to find it by any means available.) 

6. Go ahead and delete everything in `nonsense/` with one command. **How did you
   do it?**

7. There's a file in `b01` called `big_data.txt`. It's 80 megabytes worth of
   random text. For reference, Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace", the novel with a
   whopping 57,287 words depicting the French invasion of Russia and the impact
   of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian
   aristocratic families with several chapters solely dedicated to
   philosophical prose, is only 3.2 megabytes large.

   For that reason, I don't recommend using `cat` to print the file. You can
   try it, but you'll be sitting there for a while. There's some text you need
   to find in there! Go find it without actually opening up the file itself!

   Two lines above the only URL in the file is a secret solution. **What is that solution?**

   Hints: What makes up a URL (https...)? What is Context Line Control?

8. Try executing `./a_script`. You should get something back that says
   `permission denied: ./a_script`. This is because files have three different
   permissions: read, write, and execute. **Which one does `a_script` need?** Change
   the file permissions so that you can run the script. **How did you do it?**

9. Finally, there's an empty file called `hello_world` in the directory. Write
   your name in it! **How did you do it?**

## Part 2: General Questions

Feel free to use Google and work in a terminal (where applicable) to
verify your conjectures.

1. What differentiates Linux/OSX from operating systems like Windows?

2. What are some differences between the command line and normal (graphical)
   usage of an OS?

3. What is the root directory in Linux filesystems? Answer conceptually, as in depth
   as you would like,

4. `ls` has a lot of cool arguments. Try using them to get extra information such as
   file permissions, owner name, owner group, file size, and late date edited. In addition, I
   want to be able to see the size and have the files ordered by last date
   edited, with the oldest files on top. How would I do this?

5. Instead of showing the first 10 lines of the file `big_data.txt`, I want to use the
   `head` command to show the first 4. How would I do that?

6. What's the difference between `cat foo > out.txt` and `cat foo >> out.txt`?

7. Briefly, what is the difference between permissive and copyleft licenses?

8. Give an example of a permissive license.

9. Give an example of (a) open-source software and (b) free, but closed-source
   software that you use.

## Part 3: Obtaining your own VM
Using the public OCF login server will allow you to do basic things like the lab above, but if you want root permission (which lets you do basically whatever you want), you'll need your own use/destroy!

Here's the problem statement:

**Using any method you prefer, create and connect to a virtual machine running any Debian-based Linux distribution. Submit a screenshot of you successfully logging into your instance.** 

In the spirit of this course and sysadmin work in general, we highly encourage you to take this opportunity to go off-script and figure out how to acquire an virtual machine. If you have difficulties getting a VM setup, ask us for help duing the lab section or make a private post on the course Ed. 



Possible suggestions if you're really stuck on this :)


There are primarily 2 ways of getting a VM - locally on your machine or on the cloud(someone else's machine):


 ### Local Setups:
  - [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
  - [UTM](https://getutm.app/) - Only for MacOS
 
 
 ### Cloud Setups:
These are usually paid services but if you have a student email berkeley or any other university they provide more than enough free credits for the purposes of this decal 
  - [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/github-students)
  - [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/free/)
  - [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/)
