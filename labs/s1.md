Welcome to OCF staff!

These staff training activities are meant to help you get familiarized with the inner workings of the OCF, and feel comfortable contributing to the OCF yourself (whether that be technically, administratively, or both)! All new, veteran, and aspiring staffers are welcome to participate in as much or as little as desired throughout the semester, but we encourage you to come every week even if it's just to hang out with us!

### What will we do in these staff trainings?
The purpose of these training labs are to cover the most useful aspects of OCF infrastructure and organization that staffers actively contribute to or interact with on a day-to-day basis. This includes:
* how to access and interact with important OCF services/servers like tsunami, supernova, puppet, webhosting, docs, ocf-web, HPC, etc.
* an overview of OCF hardware, and how to request shiny new stuff on the buysheet
* what committees are and how to get involved with them
* the RT system, and how to run staff hours
* common tools used in the OCF like Git, vim, and useful terminal commands
* kubernetes, if interest and time allows
* lots of excuses to meet other staffers and make new friends!

You **do not** need any prior experience in anything at all to participate. Concurrent enrollment in the [OCF DeCal](https://decal.ocf.berkeley.edu/) (either beginner or advanced track is ok) is encouraged for new staff.


### Getting Help
Even if you're feeling the slightest bit unsure about something, or if you're curious and want to learn more, don't hesitate to talk to other staff members! We're usually in the lab after-hours (around 8-10pm most days), or during scheduled [staff hours](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/staff-hours). If you can't make it to the lab during these times, feel free to post to the following Discord/Slack channels:
* #rebuild: technical and infrastructure-related discussion
* #administrivia: administrative discussion
* #decal-comm: discussion specific to decal and staff training content
