## Overview
This lab will go over some concepts of networking and how certain parts of a network stack are implemented and configured in linux systems.  **It is assumed that you are familiar with basic networking concepts such as those presented in [Lab b5][basic-lab].**

**Additional information about certain files discussed here can be found in their corresponding `man` pages by typing `man <filename>`.**

As with the previous labs, there will be questions sprinkled throughout- head over to Gradescope to submit your answers to them!

## Network Interfaces

**Network interfaces represent a point of connection between a computer and a network.**  Typically network interfaces are associated with a physical piece of hardware, like a network interface card.  However, interfaces can also be entirely implemented in software and have no physical counterpart -- take the loopback interface `lo` for example.  `lo` is a virtual interface; it simulates a network interface with only software.

### /etc/network/interfaces
Network interface configurations are stored under the **/etc/network/interfaces** file on your system. Here, there is plenty of room for complexity. For example, you can have certain interfaces automatically brought up by hooking them to system boot scripts or specify some interfaces to only be available under certain circumstances, with some of the provided control flow options.

This lab will go over some common configuration keywords, but there is much more to the file. For a detailed page of the features and syntax of the file simply type `man interfaces` to pull up the `man` page for the file.

Firstly, configurations are logically divided into units known as **[stanzas][stanza]**.  The **/etc/network/interfaces** file is comprised of zero or more stanzas which begin with `iface`,  `mapping`, `auto`, `allow-`, `source`, or `source-directory`.  For brevity, we will go over the two most commonly used stanzas `auto` and `iface`.

The `auto` stanza is fairly simple, its syntax is `auto <iface>`.  The `auto` stanza flags an interface to be brought up whenever `ifup` is run with the `-a` option (More on `ifup` below). Since system boot scripts use `ifup` with the `-a` option, these interfaces are brought up during boot.  Multiple `auto` stanzas will be executed in the same order as they are written in the file.

The `iface` stanzas lets you express complex configurations for individual interfaces by leveraging its features. Its syntax is `iface <iface> <address-family> <method>`.  **Let's go over some of the arguments the stanza takes.**

`<address-family>` identifies the addressing that the interface will be using. The most common address families that you're probably familiar with are:
* IPv4 denoted by `inet` in the file
* IPv6 denoted by `inet6` in the file

Address families can be configured via different methods expressed by the `<method>` option.  Some common methods you should be familiar with are:
* `loopback` defines this interface as the [loopback](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/interface-security-loopback-understanding.html).
* `dhcp` is for interface configuration via a DHCP server.
* `static` is for static interface configuration.
* `manual` brings up the interface with **no** default configuration.

Methods also have options that let you supply certain configuration parameters.  For example, for the `static` method you can additionally use the `address <ip-address>` and `netmask <mask>` options to specify the static IP address and netwask you want the interface to use.

Moreover, the `iface` stanza additionally has its own options compatible with all families and methods.  To present just a few, we have:
* `pre-[up|down] <command>` runs the given `<command>` before the interface is either taken up or down
* `post-[up|down] <command>` runs the given `<command>` after the interface is either taken up or down 

As a final note, any changes to the configurations done in this file during runtime are **not** applied automatically.  Changes have to be reloaded via calls to `ifupdown`, the de facto command suite for interacting with **/etc/network/interfaces**.

### Checkpoint
**Question 1a:** Is the result of running `ping` enough to determine whether or not you can reach a server? Why or why not?

**Question 1b:** Here's a quick check for your understanding -- below is a very common default configuration for `/etc/network/interfaces`:

```
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
```

In your own words, explain what this configuration does. What would happen if you deleted these lines and rebooted?

**Question 1c:** Write a few stanzas that configure an interface called `test` that is brought up on boot and given the following address: `192.168.13.37/16`.

## /proc filesystem

`proc` is a **virtual filesystem** that presents runtime system information in a file-like structure.  This file-like interface provides a standardized method for querying and interacting with the kernel, which dumps metrics in the read-only files located in this directory. Using a tool like `cat`, you can dynamically read those files at runtime.  But keep in mind, **there are no 'real' files within `proc`.**

### /proc/net/
We will be focusing on certain portions of `proc`, the first of which being **/proc/net/**.  This subdirectory in `proc` contains information about various parts of the network stack in the form of virtual files.  Many commands, such as netstat, use these files when you run them.

#### /proc/net/dev
This file contains information and statistics on network devices.  `ifconfig` is an example command that reads from this file.  Take a look below and notice how the information presented in the ifconfig output corresponds to data dumped in `dev` on how many bytes and packets have been received or transmitted by an interface.
![alt text][net-dev]

[net-dev]: https://i.imgur.com/MC03IMA.png "/proc/net/dev"

#### /proc/net/[tcp|udp|raw]
The`tcp`, `raw`, and `udp` files each contain metrics on open system sockets for their respective protocols, i.e. reading `tcp` displays info on TCP sockets.  As a side note, raw sockets are network sockets that offer a finer degree of control over the header and payload of packets at each network layer as opposed to leaving that responsibility to the kernel.  They are ideal for uses cases that send or receive packets of a type not explicitly supported by a kernel, think ICMP. For additional information check [this article][raw] out. These files are read by `ss`, `netstat`, etc. Check out the example for tcp below.

#### /proc/net/route
This file contains information about the kernel routing table.  Some commands that use this file include `ip` and `netstat`. Take a look at how the file is parsed and processed by the `netstat` command.

#### /proc/net/arp
This file contains a dump of the system's ARP cache.  The `arp` command reads from this file.  For example, look at how closely the output of the `arp` command resembles the raw text dumped by the kernel into the file.

![alt text][arp]

#### /proc/net/snmp
This file contains statistics intended to be used by SNMP agents, which are a part of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  Regardless of whether or not your system is running SNMP, the data in this file is useful for investigating the network stack.  Take the screenshot below for example, examining the fields we see `InDiscards` which according to [RFC 1213][rfc1213] indicates packets that are discarded since problems were encountered that prevented their continued processing.  Lack of buffer space is a possible cause of having a high number of discards.  Having a statistic like this one, amonst others, can help pinpoint a network issue.   For additional information on fields please refer to the header file [here][snmp-header].  The image is a bit small so feel free to **right click -> "Open image in a new tab" to magnify the output.**

### /proc/sys/
Whereas the files and subdirectories mentioned above are read-only that isn't true about the **/proc/sys** subdirectory which contains virtual files that also allow writes.  You can not only query for system runtime parameters but also write new parameters into these files.  This means you have the power to adjust kernel behavior without the need for a reboot or recompilation. 

**Mind-blowing.**

While the **/proc/sys** directory contains a variety of subdirectories corresponding to aspects of the machine, the one we will be focusing on is **/proc/sys/net** which concerns various networking topics. Depending on configurations at the time of kernel compilation, different subdirectories are made available in **/proc/sys/net**, such as `ethernet/`, `ipx/`, `ipv4/`, and etc.  Given the sheer variety of possible configurations, we will confine the scope of this discussion to the most common directories.

#### /proc/sys/net/core/
`core/` is the first subdirectory that we'll cover.  As its name implies, it deals with core settings that direct how the kernel interacts with various networking layers.

Now we can go over some specific files in this directory, their functionality, and motivations behind adjusting them.

* `message_burst` and `message_cost`
Both of these parameters take a single integer argument and together control the logging frequency of the kernel.  `message_burst` defines entry frequency and `message_cost` defines time frequency in seconds. For example, let's take a look at their defaults. `message_burst` defaults to 10 and `message_cost` defaults to 5.   This means the kernel is limited to logging 10 entries every 5 seconds.  

  When adjusting the parameters in these two files, a sysadmin must keep in mind that the tradeoff here is between the granularity of the logs and the performance/storage limitations of the system.  Increasing overall logging frequency can translate to a hit to system performance or huge log files eating up disk.  But if logging is too infrequent, parts of the network may fail silently and bugs may become much harder to identify.

* `netdev_max_backlog`
This file takes one integer parameter that defines the maximum number of packets allowed to queue on a particular interface.
* `rmem_default` and `rmem_max`
These files define the default and maximum buffer sizes for receive sockets, respectively.
* `smem_default` and `smem_max`
These files define the default and maximum buffer sizes for send sockets, respectively.

  For the above sets of system parameters, adjusting queue lengths have the nice effect of allowing our system to hold more packets and avoid dropping packets due to a fast sender for example.  This boils down to optimizing flow control.  However, there is no such thing as a free lunch.  Increasing queue sizes can only mitigate problems with arrival rates being greater than service rates for so long.  For more information on why that is check out [queueing theory][qtheory].  Moreover, having many packets stored in long queues also has its own drawback.  Storing packet information isn't free and the more packets stored in the queue, the more resources the system needs.  As a result, too many packets may lead to increased [paging] and ultimately [thrashing].  Once again, we have another tradeoff, but this time between flow control and paging.

As a sysadmin many of the configuration decisions you make will be balancing between two extremes and the optimal point isn't hard and fast.  Many times you'll have to adjust system parameters on a case-by-case basis and, after empirical testing, come to a good point.

#### /proc/sys/net/ipv4/
`ipv4/` is another common subdirectory that contains setting relevant to IPv4.  Often the settings used in this subdirectory are used, in conjunction with other tools, as a security measure to mitigate network attacks or to customize behavior when the system acts as a router.

* `icmp_echo_ignore_all`
This file configures the system's behavior towards ICMP ECHO packets.  This file has two states `0` for off and `1` for on.  If on, the system will ignore ICMP ECHO packets from every host.
* `icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts`
This file is similar to the one above, except turning this parameter on only makes the system ignore ICMP ECHO packets from broadcast and multicast.

One argument against disabling ICMP is that it makes obtaining diagnostic information about servers much harder.  The output of tools that rely on ICMP, i.e. `ping`, are no longer as useful. On the other hand, allowing ICMP might be a bad idea if your goal is to hide certain machines.  Additionally, ICMP has been used in the past in [DOS attacks][ping of death].

* `ip_forward`
Turning this parameter on permits interfaces on the system to forward packets.  Take for example, if your computer has two interfaces, each connected to two different subnets, `A` and `B`.  While your machine can individually send and receive traffic to hosts on either network, machines on `A` cannot send packets to machines on `B` via your machine.  Turning `ip_forward` on is the first step to configuring your linux machine to act as a router.  It is common to see this on machines that act as VPN servers, forwarding traffic on behalf of hosts.

* `ip_default_ttl`
This is a simple file that configures the default TTL (time to live) for outbound IP packets.
* `ip_local_port_range`
This file takes two integer parameters.  The first integer specifies the lower bound of the range and the second specifies the upper bound.  Together, the two numbers define the range of ports that can be used by TCP or UDP when a local port is needed.  For example, when a socket is instantiated to send a TCP SYN, the port given to the socket is selected by the operating system and lies within the specified range.  The ports in this range are as known as [ephemeral ports].
* `tcp_syn_retries`
This file limits the number of times the system re-transmits a SYN packet when attempting to make a connection.  When attempting to connect to either a 'flaky' host or over a 'flaky' network, setting this number higher might be desirable.  But this comes at the cost of adding additional traffic to the network and potential blocking other processes while waiting for a SYN-ACK that might never come.
* `tcp_retries1`
This file limits the number of re-transmissions before signaling the network layer about a potential problem with the connection.
* `tcp_retries2`
This file limits the number of re-transmissions before killing active connections.  This implies the following relationship: `tcp_retries2` >= `tcp_retries1`.  The two retry values configure how 'patient' your system should be when it comes to waiting on [RTOs].

### Checkpoint
**Question 2a:** Describe the `tcp_syncookies` `sysctl` option.  How can we toggle this value on, and when would we want this on?

## ARP configuration
The entries in the kernel's arp cache can be read during system runtime via **/proc/net/arp** as mentioned above.

Additionally, ARP can be configured with persistent static entries.  This typically done via a file.  Batches of static entries can be included in such a file.  The line-by-line format should be `<mac-address> <ip-address>`.  To load the file's entries into the system's ARP cache one can run `arp -f <file>`.  Typically the file that holds these entries has the path **/etc/ethers**.

Static ARP entries are cleared from the system ARP cache on reboot, meaning one would have to run the above command on each boot if we wanted the mappings to 'persist'.  To automate the procedure of running the command we can leverage the interface configuration workflow.  Recall that **/etc/network/interfaces** provides the `auto` stanza to identify interfaces to be automatically configured on boot.  Used in conjunction with the `iface` stanza and its `post-up <command>` option, we can execute the `arp -f /etc/ethers` command. This effectively has static entries 'persist' by having them added alongside interface configuration during boot.

## DNS configuration

Some of the DNS configuration files that we will be going over are **/etc/hosts**, **/etc/resolv.conf**, **/etc/nsswitch.conf**.

### /etc/hosts

This is simple text file that stores static mappings from IP addresses to hostnames.  The format for each line is `<ip-address> <cannonical-hostname> [aliases]`.  An example line would be
`31.13.70.36 www.facebook.com fb ZuccBook`

Thanks to this entry we have mapped `www.facebook.com` and any aliases we listed to `31.13.70.36`.  A very common example entry is `localhost` which also has the aliases `ip6-localhost`,`ip6-loopback` which explains why running something like `ping localhost` or `ping ip6-loopback` works. This file is one way to manually define translations for certain hostnames.

### /etc/resolv.conf
Whereas **/etc/hosts** is for static translations of specific hostnames, many times we want to dynamically resolve names by issuing a query to a name server.  There are usually many nameservers, public or private, available to fufill such a query and deciding which ones to query is the job of **/etc/resolv.conf** amongst other configuration options.

**/etc/resolv.conf** is the configuration file for the system resolver which is the entity that communciates with DNS name servers on your machine's behalf.  If this file does not exist, queries will default to the name server on your local machine.  This file consists of one `domain` or `search` lines up to three `nameserver` lines and any number of options.  Let's dive into the details behind these configuration options.

* `domain`
Using this option will specific a local domain name.  Short queries, which are queries that don't contain any domain identifiers, then have the local domain appended to them during DNS queries.

  To understand this better take `death` as one of the machines within the OCF domain, `ocf.berkeley.edu`.  One can issue a DNS query for death by typing `dig death.ocf.berkeley.edu` but that's an awful lot to type.  By specifying `domain ocf.berkeley.edu` in **/etc/resolv.conf** the query can be shortened to just `dig death`.  In fact, any tool that takes a domain name can now use this shortened version, i.e. `ping death`.  This is because your machine's resolver is responsible for translating this domain name, and the `domain` configuration automatically appends the written domain to these short queries.
* `search`
The format for this option is `search <search-list>`.  Using this options specifies a list of domain names to iterate through when attempting to look up queries.  

  Let's examine an example use case, imagine we owned two networks `ocf.berkeley.edu` and `xcf.berkeley.edu` and wanted to query a machine which may either be in either network.  To enable this we can simply add the line `search ocf.berkeley.edu xcf.berkeley.edu`.  Queries to resolve a domain name will now append those listed domains in order until a successful DNS response.  If we assume `death` is on `ocf.berkeley.edu` and another machine, `life`, is on `xcf.berkeley.edu`, both `dig death` and `dig life` are now resolved properly thanks to our configuration.

One thing to note is that **`search` and `domain` are mutually exclusive keywords** and having both defined causes the last instance to take precedence and override earlier entries.

* `nameserver`
The `nameserver` keyword is fairly self explanatory and follows the format of `nameserver <ip-address>` where `<ip-address>` is the IP address of the intended name server.  One can have up to `MAXNS` (default 3) `nameserver` entries in this file.  The resolver will query nameservers in the same order as they are written in the file.

Following are additional useful configurable options in this file. Options are defined in this format `options <option1> [additional-options]`.  Some example options follow below:

* `ndots`
This option, formatted as `ndots:n`, configures the threshold,`n`, at which  an initial absolute query is made.  Since the default value for this option is 1, any name with at least 1 dot will first be queried as an absolute name before appending domains from `search`.  When less than `ndots` are present, the queries automatically begin appending elements in `<search-list>`.

  Take `death.ocf.berkeley.edu` as an example, and  let's assume we have the following line `search ocf.berkeley.edu` in our configuration.  Running `ping death` works because there are 0 dots in `death` and the query automatically appends `search` elements so that our query becomes `death.ocf.berkeley.edu`.  If we instead ran `ping death.` the resolver will first issue a query for `death.` since it has 1 dot, which fails.

* `timeout`
This opton is in the format `timeout:n` and configures the amount of time `n`, in seconds, that a resolver will wait for a response from a name server before retrying the query via another name server.

* `attempts`
This option is in the format `attempts:n` and configures the number of attempts `n` that the resolver will make to the entire list of name servers in this file.

### /etc/nsswitch.conf
With multiple sources of information for resolving hostnames, one can't help but wonder how the system decides which sources to query and in what order.  This is answered with the **/etc/nsswitch.conf** file.  It is this file's responsibility to list sources of information and configure prioritization between sources.  Similar information sources can be grouped into categories that are referred to as 'databases' within the context of the file.  The format of the file is as follows: `database [sources]`.  While this file provides configuration for a wide array of name-service databases, we will focus on an example relevant to the topic at hand.

The `hosts` database configures the behavior of system name resolution.  So far we have introduced two ways to resolve names:
1. Using entries in **/etc/hosts**
2. Using a resolver to issue DNS queries to DNS name servers

To let the system know about the above two sources of information there are corresponding keywords, `files` and `dns`, respectively. 

We can then configure name resolution by writing the line
`hosts: files dns` 
The example syntax above tells the system to first prioritize files before issuing DNS queries.  Naturally, this can be customized to best fit your use case.

## DHCP client configuration
The Internet Systems Consortium DHCP client, known as *dhclient*, ships with Debian and can be configured via **/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf**.  Lines in this file are terminated with a semicolon unless contained within brackets, like in the C programming language.  Some potentially interesting parameters to configure include:

### Timing
* `timeout`
This format for this statement is `timeout <time>` and defines time to the maximum amount of time, in seconds, that a client will wait for a response from a DHCP server.

  Once a timeout has occured the client will look for static leases defined in the configuration file, or unexpired leases in **/var/lib/dhclient/dhclient.leases**. The client will loop through these leases and if it finds one that appears to be valid, it will use that lease's address. If there are no valid static leases or unexpired leases in the lease database, the client will restart the protocol after the defined `retry` interval.

* `retry`
The format for this statement is `retry <time>` and configures the amount of time, in seconds, that a client must wait after a timeout before attempting to contact a DHCP server again.


A client with multiple network interfaces may require different behaviour depending on the interface being configured. Timing parameters and certain declarations can be enclosed in an interface declaration, and those parameters will then be used only for the interface that matches the specified name.

The syntax for an example interface snippet is:
```
interface <iface-name> {
    send host-name "death.ocf.berkeley.edu";
    request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
       domain-search, domain-name, domain-name-servers, host-name;
    [additional-declarations];
}

```

As mentioned above this file also supports defining static leases via a `lease` declaration.  Defining such leases may be useful as a fallback in the event that a DHCP server cannot be contacted.

The syntax for a example static lease is:
```
lease {
#  interface "eth0";
#  fixed-address 192.33.137.200;
#  option host-name "death.ocf.berkeley.edu";
#  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
#  option broadcast-address 192.33.137.255;
#  option routers 192.33.137.250;
#  option domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;
#  renew 2 2000/1/12 00:00:01;
#  rebind 2 2000/1/12 00:00:01;
#  expire 2 2000/1/12 00:00:01;
#}
```

While the function of most keywords in the above snippet can be inferred from their syntax, more information can be found by simply reading the `man` page for this file (`man dhclient.conf`).

## Sysadmin commands

### ifupdown
`ifupdowm` is a simple suite of commands for interacting with network interfaces.  The two commands you'll be using most are `ifup` and `ifdown` which are relatively self-explanatory.  `ifup` brings and interface up and vice versa for `ifdown`.  These two commands should be your de facto commands for bringing interfaces up or down since using these commands loads configurations defined in **/etc/network/interfaces**.

### mtr
`mtr` is a command that combines the functionality of `traceroute` with that of `ping`. Take a look at [this article][mtr-primer] for a good primer for using `mtr` and interpreting its output.

### Checkpoint
**Question 3a:**  If we preferred name resolution be done dynamically rather than using static entries in **/etc/hosts** what file do we need to edit and what is the line we should add?

**Question 3b:**  Assume the following information:
* **/etc/resolv.conf** file has 3 `nameserver` entries and a `options timeout:1` entry.
* A successful DNS response takes 20 ms.

    You need to add the `attempts:n` option so that you retry a query as many times as possible but the total time to resolve a name, irrelevant of success or failure, takes less than **5** seconds.  What should the value of n be?


# Exercises

Now, let's ~~break things~~ do some experimentation! Remember to submit your answers to Gradescope when you're done. **(Also, don't forget to submit the checkpoint questions from the sections above!)**

The files for these exercises can be found in the [decal-labs][decal-labs] repository. Clone it now: `git clone https://github.com/0xcf/decal-labs`

## 🔥 This is fine 🔥
This section will have you thinking like a sysadmin.  

### IMPORTANT NOTE
**Do not run the scripts directly in your student VM!** These scripts are **dangerous** and will brick your VM so **please follow the provided setup instructions.** However, if you have physical access (or out-of-band management access) to a Linux machine, feel free to run the scripts directly and reboot when necessary, as all changes made are temporary.

Each script might make changes to your network stack with the intent of damaging your machine's connectivity. To confine the scope of the 'attacks', scripts will specifically try to alter your connectivity to `google.com` and `ocf.berkeley.edu`.

### Setup

1. If you haven't already, ssh into your student VM (`username@username.decal.xcf.sh`) and clone [decal-labs][decal-labs].
3. Go into the vm directory: `cd decal-labs/a6/vm`
4. Get Virtualbox: `sudo apt install virtualbox`
5. Get Vagrant: `curl -O https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.2.18/vagrant_2.2.18_x86_64.deb` then `sudo apt install ./vagrant_2.2.18_x86_64.deb`
6. Get Ansible: `sudo apt install ansible`
7. Start a Vagrant instance: `vagrant up`
8. Enter your Vagrant instance: `ssh vagrant@192.168.42.42`. The default password is `vagrant`.
9. The `decal-labs` repo should be available in the Vagrant instance. If it isn't there, you can `sudo apt install git` then clone it again.
10. `cd decal-labs/a6/scenario`.


### Problem Instructions

There should be 6 scripts, named `1.py` to `6.py`. Your task is to **choose at least 3 of these to run and attempt to fix the problem that they cause (if any).**

Launch each script with sudo, i.e. `sudo python3 <script.py>`.

For each script, follow this two step process.  **Only move onto another script once you have finished resolving your current one.**

1. Analyze whether or not your connectivity has been damaged. If your stack has been damaged identify the issue or which part of your network is no longer functioning as intended.

2. If you concluded there was a problem, resolve the issue.  What commands did you use and how did you conclude things were fully functional again?

   **Additionally, for each step you must explain the tools you used and how you came to your  conclusions i.e.** 

      > I ran `example --pls --fix computer` and I noticed that line 3: `computer-is-broken` meant my machine was f*****.

      > This script damaged my ability to connect to google.com by poisoning my arp cache with bogus entries.

### Debugging Bank

**I can't ssh into my Vagrant instance!**
 - You might need to run `vagrant provision` and then re-run `vagrant up`.
 - Also, make sure you're running `ssh 192.168.42.42` and not `vagrant ssh`.

**I accidentally bricked something, how do I reset my Vagrant instance?**
 - Run `vagrant destroy` and then `vagrant up` in the `vm` folder.

**I've tried running `vagrant provision` a bunch of times and it never seems to work :(**
 - As an alternative to installing Vagrant on your student VM, you can also try [installing it on your local machine](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads).

**I accidentally ran the scripts in my student VM and not in the Vagrant instance and now I can't log in. What do I do?**
 - You'll need to ask us to reset your VM. Contact us in #decal-general or over email to arrange this.

## Net Ninjas (Optional)
**Run this in your Vagrant instance. The file should be found in `decal-labs/a6/`.**
1. The ninja has spent a few years training in a dojo and has mastered fireball (`火球`) jutsu.  He can use his new skills to tamper with your network stack, incinerating your attempts to catch him.  Run `sudo python3 advanced_ninja_port.py`.  Fix the damage he has done and then successfully send him a `found you` message!
