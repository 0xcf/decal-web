## Overview

At any given moment, there are anywhere from dozens to thousands of process running on a Unix system. The large majority of these processes, called daemons, run in the background. Daemons are crucial to having a usable system and provide much of a system’s core functionality, including the graphics server, sound server, and networking services to name a few.

Today we’ll explore these background processes and create some of our own! **Make sure the following exercises are executed on your VM unless explicitly specified otherwise.** Make sure to answer the questions on Gradescope as you work through the lab!

## Which processes are running on my system?

Open up a terminal and run the `ps` command. You should see something like this: 

```
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 3371 pts/2    00:00:00 zsh
 3416 pts/2    00:00:00 ps
```

Now open up **another** terminal and run `sleep 1000 &`, which start a sleeping process in the background. Then run `ps`. It should look like:

```
~
❯ sleep 100 &
[1] 3726

~
❯ ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 3371 pts/2    00:00:00 zsh
 3726 pts/2    00:00:00 sleep
 3752 pts/2    00:00:00 ps
```

In the **first** terminal run `ps` again. You should notice that the `sleep` process is not showing up, even though the thousand seconds haven’t expired. **(Exercise 1)** Why do you think this behavior occurs (hint: TTY column)?

We can get the process to display on the first terminal by running `ps -u`, which displays all the processes running as your user. Notice the PID column; each process has a unique ID assigned to it by the kernel. One thing we can do with this PID is send signals to the process. `sleep 1000` is pretty useless, so go ahead and kill it – `kill 3726` (substitute `3726` with whatever PID `ps` outputted for you).

The most common use of `ps` is to run `ps -ef` to see all the processes running on the system. Run `ps -e` and `ps -f` independently to see how the flags work together.

## htop

Make sure `htop` is installed by running `sudo apt install htop`. Now, open up a terminal and run the `htop` command. `htop` can be thought of as a more extensive version of `ps -ef`, whereby process stats are updated in real-time.

First press `<F2>`, scroll down to Display options, and check “Hide userland process threads.” We won’t be dealing with those in this lab.

Now open up another terminal and SSH into your VM. Run the command `yes`. It uses a lot of resources as it prints a continuous stream of `y`’s. **(Exercise 2)** What resource specifically does the `yes` command exhaust? If you are having trouble finding this, press `<` to choose which resource to order processes by. Make sure to quit out of `yes` (^C) once you are finished.

### The process hierarchy

Run `htop` once more. This time click `<F5>` to enter Tree View. You should see a visual representation of the process hierarchy on your system, with everything stemming from `/sbin/init` (systemd).

For curious students that are interested in seeing a more extensive process hierarchy on a large system, you are encouraged to run `htop` on the OCF server `tsunami`. Let us know of any cool processes that you find!

### Orphan processes

Open a second terminal and `ssh` to your VM. Now run `sleep 1000 &`. You should see this new process pop into your `htop` session on your first terminal. If not, press `<F3>` and search for “sleep.” **(Exercise 3)** What is its parent?

Select this parent and press `<F9>` to kill it. Send the `SIGTERM` signal. The sleep process now has `init` as its new parent, which is PID 1\. What you just did is manually orphan a process; when that happens said process is subsequently re-parented by the `init` process.

Now go through the same steps again. This time, send the parent a `SIGHUP` (hangup) signal. Can you still find the sleep process? When `SIGHUP` is sent to a parent shell, the parent subsequently sends hangup signals to any child processes before terminating; all processes that receive `SIGHUP` from a parent shell will terminate – this is one way to avoid creating orphan processes.

If you are interested in learning about the different signals, run `man 7 signal`. Note that you can run `man man` for an explanation about the different manual section numbers.

## Cron

So much infrastructure in the computing world relies on scheduled processes. This is the job of the cron daemon, an automatic process scheduler. For example, at the OCF, we use a cron job that runs every thirty minutes to keep our servers and desktops updated via `puppet`. 

Process scheduling is defined in a crontab file. Each line in the file represents a different job. A line consists of a time descriptor, typically a sequence of 5 terms separated by spaces, and a command to be run at that time. 

For example, the line:

`5 12 2 8 * echo "It is 12:05 on August 2nd" >> $HOME/crontest.txt`

would append "It is 12:05 on August 2nd" to a file in your home directory at 12:05 on August 2nd. You can find an interactive editor to help you with the time descriptors at [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru)!

To get a feel for the cron scheduler, we’re going to write a basic cron job.

**(Exercise 4)** Open the cron editor by running `crontab -e` (if the editor of your choice isn’t being launched, set the `EDITOR` environment variable), which will create a crontab for your user. Below is a sample task. Put this in your crontab:

`* * * * * date +"\%T" >> $HOME/timestamps.txt`

Right now this runs every minute. Modify it to run every five minutes and make a note of the line you wrote. Then, quit out of the editor.

If you get stuck, visit [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru)! (Seriously, it's a lifesaver!)

## Job Control

For this section of the lab you will need to get the necessary code from GitHub:

`git clone https://github.com/0xcf/decal-labs.git`

If you already have the code run `git pull` in your `decal-labs` directory.

Now enter the `b6` directory in the `decal-labs` repository and split your terminal with the multiplexer of your choice (I recommend `tmux`). In one pane run `./job.sh > ~/count` and in the other run `less +F ~/count`. You should see the `less` command increments every half a second or so. Now run `Ctrl+Z` in the pane with the `job.sh` command. This will suspend the process. **(Exercise 5)** What happens when you suspend the `job` command?

Now, let’s resume our suspended process. Since we only have one job, we can just run `bg`. **(Exercise 6)** What happens after running the `bg` command?

Now let’s bring our job to the foreground. First run `jobs -l`. You should see both the job number (in brackets) and the pid of the job. We’ll bring the job to the foreground by running `fg %i` (where `i` is the number that showed up in the brackets when you ran `jobs -l`) and kill it using `Ctrl+C`. **(Exercise 7)** What is another way we can kill the job (Hint: `kill` also recognizes the `%` syntax)?

## Exploration

Congratulations, you have completed the lab! This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to processes. If you want to learn more, here are some related topics you can look into.

Bear in mind that this document is a little dated when it comes to the code about threads, and its description of what happens when a pseudotty is closed is not actually correct.
