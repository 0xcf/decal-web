Hello cluster wranglers! I hope you all are finishing up your labs and finishing the semester strong. Although the decal is nearly over, be sure to read through these final announcements!

- The OCF will host a tech talk this Wednesday, 4/24, from 8-9 PM from one of our previous DeCal heads, Ben Cuan!!
    - He will talk about cloud computing and infrastructure (vital Sysadmin knowledge!)
    - Essentially, it's a guest lecture from an alumni :D
- We are looking for facilitators for next semester! If you're interested, please fill out the [Fall 2024 Facilitator Interest Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrum90SNjJ1raB1PkoxcwdQhld0tMoXLvYUJ9GxNGP8AAYmA/viewform?usp=sharing).
    - Fill out this and attend a Student Facilitator training ASAP if you would like to receive 1 unit for facilitating! More information is in the form.
- We will try to get out the P/NP emails later this week.
    - I'd meant to send them out last week, but got a bit busy. Sorry about that.
    - If you're at risk of not passing, email us ASAP! We'll try to help work things out.
- Use the *[extension form](https://forms.gle/GDDa5ixTnYQxG5zU9)* to request a lab drop or extension.
    - If you turn in any labs or vitamins late, or intend to, please fill out this out for those.
- Any questions? Post on Ed or reach us at [decal@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:decal@ocf.berkeley.edu)!
