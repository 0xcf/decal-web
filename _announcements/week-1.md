Hi all, this is our first official week for this semester's Linux SysAdmin decal! 
Enrollment codes will be emailed by Monday to students that was accepted. Our 
lecture and lab will be at their normal time on **Tuesday 7-8pm and 8-9pm** respectively. 
If you're in the Experimental Decal, it will be on **Thursday 7-8pm and 8-9pm**.
The lab is now open and you can get a head start if you wish, or you can start during lab time.
We're looking forward to teaching this class and hope you find the content
engaging!
