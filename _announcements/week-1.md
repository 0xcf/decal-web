Hi all, this is our first official week for this semester's Linux SysAdmin decal! At this point, you should know if you are enrolled in the class, and we'll be starting our regular schedule this week. Monday 09/04 is Labor Day, but this won't be impacting our class. Our lecture and lab will be at their normal time on **Tuesday 7-8pm and 8-9pm** respectively. The lab is now open and you can get a head start if you wish, or start during lab time on Tuesday. We're looking forward to teaching this class and hope you find the content engaging!
