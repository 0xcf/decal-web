Hello everyone! Welcome to the Linux Sysadmin Decal! Here are your week 1 announcements:

1. The first weekâ€™s labs and lectures have been released! You can view them below. Due to the short notice of this message, **you don't need to watch lecture before the lab section this week.**
2. Live lab sections begin this week at 8pm Tuesday and Thursday! For instructions on how to navigate to the lab, see [ocf.io/lab](https://ocf.io/lab) **Due to high demand for the beginner track, we are opening up Thursday sections to beginner students as well.**
3. In the unlikely event that the physical lab capacity is exceeded, in-person labs will be **first come, first served** with priority given to officially enrolled students.
4. As a reminder, **in-person attendance is not required.** You can get attendance credit by either attending lab or completing the participation assignment on Gradescope.
5. The lab and participation assignments are due on **Saturday, February 5 at 11:59pm.**
6. Any questions? Just make a post on Piazza or contact us at [decal@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:decal@ocf.berkeley.edu)!
