Hi all, this is our first official week for this semester's Linux SysAdmin
decal! Sorry for the delay in releasing enrollment codes, we will have those
emailed today to students that applied. Our lecture and lab will be at their
normal time on **Tuesday 7-8pm and 8-9pm** respectively. The lab is now open
and you can get a head start if you wish, or you can start during lab time.
We're looking forward to teaching this class and hope you find the content
engaging!
