As we enter midterm season hope your classes have been treating you well, network engineers! This week we'll be taking a look at many concepts that help build the foundation of how our computers connect and talk over the internet. As usual we'll be holding lecture and lab in the OCF or online at [ocf.io/decalzoom](https://ocf.io/decalzoom) on Tuesday from 7-9pm!

- If you need an extension on this lab or any of the previous ones, please fill out the [late lab form](/latelab).
- Interested in becoming volunteer staff at the OCF? Come to our weekly staff meetings Wednesdays from 8-9pm in the lab at 171 MLK!
- If you have any questions please let us know on Ed or by emailing [decal@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:decal@ocf.berkeley.edu).
