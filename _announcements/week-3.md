Hey Linux Lovers! Get ready to dive into the wonderful world of Linux packages this week! Whether you're a package pro or just starting to learn, weâ€™ll be exploring the ins and outs of managing software on our favorite operating system. Bring your questions and curiosity to the OCF Lab or online at [ocf.io/decalzoom](https://ocf.io/decalzoom) on Tuesday from 7-9pm!

- We're currently experiencing an unexpected outage affecting the student VMs, so you may not be able to connect to your VM at the moment. We'll post updates to Ed but if it's not resolved by Wednesday we'll push back the deadline of this week's lab.
- If you find yourself in need of an extension on this lab or any of the previous ones, please fill out the [late lab form](/latelab).
- Interested in becoming volunteer staff at the OCF? Come to our weekly staff meetings Wednesdays from 8-9pm in the lab at 171 MLK!
- If you have any questions please let us know on Ed or by emailing [decal@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:decal@ocf.berkeley.edu).
