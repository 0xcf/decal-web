1. Solutions for the second week's labs have been released, from now on we will be releasing solutions after the lab is due.
1. We have added a **new policy for requesting excused lab extensions** under the **Lab Assignments** section on the **About** page on our website.
1. If you need to request an **excused lab extension**, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/KX5o2WLYcJqgxCZE9). Doing so will not affect your two unexcused late labs.
1. DigitalOcean VMs have been sent out to all students. If you have not recieved one and would like to, please make a private post on Piazza.
1. Live lab sections will be held in a hybrid format at 8pm Tuesday/Thursday for both tracks. **There won't be a lab lottery**; all students are free to attend either lab in-person!
1. The labs can also be joined online at [ocf.io/decalzoom](https://ocf.io/decalzoom).
1. **Office hours** will be held after the lab section from **9-10 PM**, these will be in-person at the OCF and remotely via Zoom.
