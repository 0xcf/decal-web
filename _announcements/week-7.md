Hello everyone! Welcome to the Linux Sysadmin Decal! Here are your week 7 announcements:

1. The seventh week’s labs and lectures have been released! You can view them below.
2. Due to minor issues with the participation assignments, we will give everyone who submitted the first 4 assignments full credit, regardless of your score. If you’d like to go back and figure out the correct answers though, we’ve reopened them and you can resubmit them as you like. \
We will be going back to the original policy of a score of at least 5/10 being required for participation credit. So, you can either attend live lab to receive the code (worth 5 points), or get all of the lecture questions correct with instant feedback (also worth 5 points).
3. Lab 4 solutions have been released!
4. For additional late labs, please submit the late [lab from](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSde6CIiaA1Z-U3vSxDU_AbmyyWKEVPKa-vhHEysltLsG2de3A/viewform)
5. Live lab sections are at 8pm Tuesday and Thursday! For instructions on how to navigate to the lab, see [ocf.io/lab](https://ocf.io/lab). **Due to high demand for the beginner track, we are opening up Thursday sections to beginner students as well.**
6. As a reminder, **in-person attendance is not required.** You can get attendance credit by either attending lab or completing the participation assignment on Gradescope.
7. The lab and participation assignments are due in 2 weeks on **Saturday, March 26 at 11:59pm.**
8. Any questions? Just make a post on Piazza or contact us at [decal@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:decal@ocf.berkeley.edu)!
