Sorry we missed last week's announcement folks, but we're so back and better than ever this week with version control and backups! We'll see you all at lecture and lab in the OCF or online at [ocf.io/decalzoom](https://ocf.io/decalzoom) on Tuesday from 7-9pm.

- We're working on catching up with grading your past few labs, so if you see anything weird with your grades please submit a regrade request or make a private post on Ed!
- If you need an extension on this lab or any of the previous ones, please fill out the [late lab form](/latelab).
- Interested in becoming volunteer staff at the OCF? Come to our weekly staff meetings Wednesdays from 8-9pm in the lab at 171 MLK!
- If you have any questions please let us know on Ed or by emailing [decal@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:decal@ocf.berkeley.edu).
