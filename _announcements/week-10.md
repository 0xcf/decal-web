We're in the final stretch now, sysadmins! This week we'll be talking about infrastructure as code with a special emphasis on Puppet. See you all at lecture and lab in the OCF or online at [ocf.io/decalzoom](https://ocf.io/decalzoom) on Tuesday from 7-9pm.

- We're working on catching up with grading your past few labs, so if you see anything weird with your grades please submit a regrade request or make a private post on Ed!
- If you need an extension on this lab or any of the previous ones, please fill out the [late lab form](/latelab).
- Interested in becoming volunteer staff at the OCF? Come to our weekly staff meetings Wednesdays from 8-9pm in the lab at 171 MLK!
- If you have any questions please let us know on Ed or by emailing [decal@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:decal@ocf.berkeley.edu).
