We are nearing the end of the semester! I hope everyone learned a lot from the Linux Sysadmin DeCal :')

- CUDA (NVIDIA) lecture (optional), will be hosted next week, 12/5 (date changed!!)
- Feel free to reach out to us if you are unable to keep up with the material for whatever reason-- we are friendly!
- Any questions? Post on Ed or reach us at [decal@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:decal@ocf.berkeley.edu)!
  - It's been a busy time, so apologies for any delays in getting back to questions (especially regarding grades)!
