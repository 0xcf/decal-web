Hello everyone! Welcome to the Linux Sysadmin Decal! Here are your week 2 announcements:

1. The second weekâ€™s labs and lectures have been released! You can view them below.
2. Live lab sections are at 8pm Tuesday and Thursday! For instructions on how to navigate to the lab, see [ocf.io/lab](https://ocf.io/lab) **Due to high demand for the beginner track, we are opening up Thursday sections to beginner students as well.**
3. In the unlikely event that the physical lab capacity is exceeded, in-person labs will be **first come, first served** with priority given to officially enrolled students.
4. As a reminder, **in-person attendance is not required.** You can get attendance credit by either attending lab or completing the participation assignment on Gradescope.
5. The lab and participation assignments are due on **Saturday, February 12 at 11:59pm.**
6. Any questions? Just make a post on Piazza or contact us at [decal@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:decal@ocf.berkeley.edu)!
