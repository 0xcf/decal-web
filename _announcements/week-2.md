Welcome to week 2, sysadmins! We'll be learning about the shell and shell scripting this week, facilitated by Jaysa and Albert. As usual, lecture and lab will be held in MLK 171 and online at https://ocf.io/decalzoom on Tuesday from 7-9pm.

- Applications are now closed for the DeCal but if you would like to audit you can still follow along on this website!
- If you need extra time to complete lab 1 or you anticipate needing more time to finish lab 2, please fill out the [late lab form](/latelab).
- Interested in becoming volunteer staff at the OCF? Come to our weekly staff meetings Wednesdays from 8-9pm in the lab at 171 MLK!
- Hopefully you have all tried to log in to your student VMs by now, but if they don't work for any reason make a private post on Ed and we'll help sort it out!
- If you have any questions please let us know on Ed or by emailing [decal@ocf.berkeley.edu](mailto:decal@ocf.berkeley.edu).
